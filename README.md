# SpaceX-Starship
These are the first steps in programming the SpaceX Block2 Starship in blender

This is the current status of my work on the SpaceX Starship model in Blender. There's still a lot to do and I'll keep updating this. 
I create the geometries with software in Blender, because due to the constant changes to the Starship and the level of detail, 
modeling by hand would be far too time-consuming and would never produce such good results. 
The enormous advantage with software-generated geometry is the easy adjustment when changes occur. 
Instead of complex modeling, I just need to adjust the relevant parameters and the geometry can be regenerated.
