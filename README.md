# SpaceX-Starship
These are the first steps in programming the SpaceX Block2 Starship in blender

This is the current status of my work on the SpaceX Starship model in Blender. There's still a lot to do and I'll keep updating this. 
I create the geometries with software in Blender, because due to the constant changes to the Starship and the level of detail, 
modeling by hand would be far too time-consuming and would never produce such good results. 
The enormous advantage with software-generated geometry is the easy adjustment when changes occur. 
Instead of complex modeling, I just need to adjust the relevant parameters and the geometry can be regenerated.

Since the starship's steel hull is very detailed with its many welding points, I had the idea of ​​programming the texture as well. 
This is much better than doing it all by hand in gimp. Because of the level of detail, very high-resolution textures would be needed, e.g. 32k. 
With my virtual texture system it wouldn't be a problem to stream it online in seconds without the devices themselves needing large power reserves for the large textures.

But at the moment this is still a thing of the future. To be honest, I don't want to open source my virtual texture system and my virtual geometry system just yet, 
as I have had very negative experiences in the German car industry. There is only taking but never support.

P.S. I now have a newer version with continuous tiles on the fuselage. However, this is 2 mb too big for github. I will probably offer it as a download on my website.
